    <h1 id="Hydro">Hydro-Devil 4.5</h1>
    <p>Our car is hydro powered to make sure that it is environmentally friendly. This will lead to reduced environmental footprint, improved fuel efficiency, reduced emission amongst many other improvements.
Did you know, over 1,300,000 people worldwide die from road accidents per year? As a result, our car will include up-to-date safety features.
</p>
    <p>Automatic Braking <br>
Multiple motion sensors and camera that detects movement around the car. AI then analyzes the potential of a crash and makes the decision to decelerate or stop turning within a single millisecond. <br> Airbags (Internal) <br>
	Internal airbags. Simple, but effective <br>

Autopilot <br>
The car will have a driver assistance system that will allow the car to steer, accelerate, and brake all on its own. Will allow driving to be easier and less accident prone. <br> Traffic Light Detection <br>
		Alongside autopilot, our cars will be able to detect the current state of traffic lights during manual driving, such as when they’re green or red. </p>
